Task Description

## Task Overview

1. Diagram the mechanism of how a user obtains their desired beverage from a vending machine (format is flexible).
2. Express the main logic from (1) using a programming language of your choice (format is flexible).
    1. You can choice on Java, Kotlin, Javascript, Typescript, Clojure

### Task Details

1. Express the key logic required for the operation of the vending machine.
2. Try to account for as many cases and exceptions as possible.
3. The code should be executable.
    1. Output can be done via log printing.
    2. Framework usage is optional.
4. For diagrams, it‚Äôs okay to organize requirements and details in a separate document, but keep it under three pages.
    1. The diagram should ideally fit on one page.
5. You don‚Äôt need to spend too much time.
    1. The estimated time to complete the assignment, including both the diagram and coding, is approximately 3 hours.
    2. It is recommended to limit the total time spent on the assignment to no more than 6 hours.

### Evaluation Points

1. Documentation that is easily understandable by multiple people.
2. Consideration of possible cases and scenarios.
3. `Code` structure and its style.
    1. Whether appropriate techniques were used
    2. Whether the code is easy to read
    3. Whether the right names were used in variables, functions, files, and etc.

### Prerequisite

1. Payment methods available to the user:
    1. Cash: 100 KRW / 500 KRW / 1,000 KRW / 5,000 KRW / 10,000 KRW are accepted.
    2. Card: Card payment is possible.
2. Beverages available for purchase:
    1. Cola: 1,100 KRW
    2. Water: 600 KRW
    3. Coffee: 700 KRW
3. Need to work on the logics and processes for the possible situations

### Submission Deliverables

<aside>
üí° Submit both (1) and (2) as a link (Git) or compressed file via email.

</aside>

1. Mechanism diagram document (pdf, png, word, ppt, etc.)
2. Code output
3. `Submission format`
    1. Git repo
        1. The name of the git repository should be ‚Äú{`englishname`}-vending-machine‚Äù
            1. ex) mark-vending-machine
    2. File compression
        1. The name of the compressed folder or file should be ‚Äú{`englishname`}-vending-machine.zip‚Äù
            1. ex) mark-vending-machine.zip
